# Charging-station-siting-and-sizing

This work was conducted as part of my Ph.D. thesis and was published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2024.

Here is a short abstract of the problem:

In the past decade, the rising demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging has caused fluctuating inflows at charging stations (CSs), necessitating efficient infrastructure planning to determine optimal locations and capacities. This challenge, known as the Charging Station Siting and Sizing Problem (CSSSP), is complicated by uncertain EV inflow, limited charging ports, and unpredictable queueing times, resulting in unsatisfied charging demand. To address this, we model time-varying EV demand using statistical distributions and propose a queueing mechanism that limits waiting times to a threshold. An iterative heuristic algorithm is developed, starting with an initial port allocation and followed by a statistical approximation to estimate unmet demand. Charging ports are then intelligently reallocated to minimize dissatisfaction. The process is repeated until unmet demand is minimized. The method is validated through Monte Carlo simulations and comparative analysis.
